# 3 Best AI powered VSCode extension
### If you can't beat them... üëÄ

With the arrival of ChatGPT, it seems like AI is all the hype now, at first like any software developer, I wasn't to much at first, "How could it replace me, surely the AI overlord doesn't consider the X, Y and Z...", I asked myself over my daily cup of coffee?

After I sniffed enough *copium* to feel good about myself, I read a quote which put it in perspective quite quickly:

> AI might not be fully be able to replace a human, but a Human using AI will
*- some random guy on the internet*

So instead of fighting the rise of new tools like ChatGPT and the newly Released GPT-4 multi-modal, it's time to start integrating these into your workflow and become a better developer.

## 1. GitHub Copilot üßëüèª‚Äçüíª
![Github Copilot Example](https://res.cloudinary.com/thurling/image/upload/v1679287108/Blog%20Posts/5%20Best%20AI%20tools/github_copilot_example.gif) 
Now...this will probably not be of any surprise, GitHub Co-pilot is possibly one of the more well known AI tools out there and after playing around with it for about a month, I do have some gripes with it, but it did streamline my workflow, especially when it came to repetitive tasks,

Some times the things it recommend are completely wrong, but often times it gives you just enough boilerplate logic to be useful.

Try Github Co-Pilot [here](https://github.com/features/copilot)

## 2. Mintlify Writer ‚úçüèª

During some point in your career, you will be asked to Document your code and that's when you soul slowly dies inside, for the following reasons:

 1. You might be fired üëÄ (...)
 2. Other Devs are moving onto your project and you don't want them touching your stuff
 3. It's one long an boring process
 
Enter Mintlify Writer, you can select a code snippet and it will analyse what the code's doing and generate a nice comment with the required parameters, with a nice explanation about what it's doing.

Try Mintlify Writer [here](https://writer.mintlify.com/)

## 3. Code Attendant üë©üèª‚Äç‚úàÔ∏è

So I'll be honest most of the AI tools currently are mostly focused on generating code, "but, Mr., you already have  Github Co-pilot on the list, why to I have another one?".  

And to that I say, *Code Attendant* is for those annoying code snippets you always need to google because you possibly forgot about the feature that was already built into the language. Haven't worked with JavaScript in a while, you possibly forgot how to get all specific elements using the `querySelector`, this is where this is extremely useful, I am not dragging my browser out and searching something I forgot for the millionth time and break my state of *flow*, instead I can do everything while I am busy developing.

### Summary

AI is here to stay and tools like these should be used and learned as it combines the best of both world and makes one much more productive, and stay in the state of flow for longer and easier.

TL:DR

 1. Github Co-Pilot
 2. Mintlify Writer
 3. Code Attendant
