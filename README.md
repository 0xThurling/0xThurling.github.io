I am a software engineer and very bad music lover that tinkers with programming languages and dumb tech ideas.

So without further ado, welcome to my blog, this will mainly be me ranting about things I find interesting about tech, music, life and well...that's it really. If this interests you and you want to stay up to date with the latest ramblings, consider giving me a follow.
