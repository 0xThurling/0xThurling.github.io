I am Jacques Thurling. Much wow.

Nothing really more to say about myself, started as a dev for the memes when I got a random job.
Ended up running everything for the company.

Now currently working as a software dev at a private financial institution building investment systems.
I make people's money go brrrrrrrr.

Building new stuff that interests me.
